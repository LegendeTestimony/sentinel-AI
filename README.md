## 🧠 Judge TL;DR

**Sentinel AI is a long-running autonomous security agent that uses Gemini 3 Flash to predict how files and URLs will behave before execution.**

- **No sandboxing** — predicts behavior without running code
- **No signature matching** — pure reasoning from structure, entropy, and context
- **Runs continuously for days** — learning baselines and self-correcting
- **Marathon Agent** — 6-stage investigation loops with autonomous quarantine decisions

**Demo in under 2 minutes:**
Run `npm run marathon-demo`, drop files into the watch folder, watch the agent reason in real time with live status reports.

## 🎯 What is Sentinel?

Sentinel is a **Marathon Security Agent** - an autonomous system that runs continuously for days/weeks, not seconds. It:

### 🏃 Marathon Capabilities (Action Era)

- **Continuous Monitoring**: Watches directories 24/7, analyzing new threats as they appear
- **Long-Running Investigations**: Multi-stage analysis loops that iterate dozens of times with self-correction
- **Temporal Learning**: Builds threat baselines over days, detecting anomalies based on historical patterns
- **Autonomous Decision-Making**: Quarantines threats, adjusts sensitivity, and self-improves without human intervention

### 🧠 Advanced Threat Detection

- **Zero-Day Malware**: Identifies novel threats through reasoning, not signatures
- **Hidden Payloads**: Detects steganography, polyglots, and embedded executables
- **Malicious URLs**: Analyzes phishing sites and suspicious web content
- **Multi-Agent Debate**: Prosecutor/Defense/Judge system for high-confidence verdicts

Unlike traditional one-shot scanners, Sentinel **never stops** - it's designed for extended autonomous operation with continuous learning and self-correction.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Marathon Mode (Recommended for Demo)

Experience autonomous multi-day security monitoring:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run marathon-demo
```

The agent runs continuously, analyzing files as they appear. **Drop test files into `marathon-demo-watch/` and watch it work!**

See [MARATHON_MODE.md](./MARATHON_MODE.md) for full details.

### Option 2: Single File Analysis

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev

# Frontend (new terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 and upload files or URLs for analysis.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

### The Background: From SEAL to Sentinel

This project evolved from my work on **SEAL** (Self-Encrypting Autonomous Layer), a file format with embedded post-breach security. SEAL files can detect unauthorized access and self-destruct after database breaches - they're autonomous and self-protecting.

While building SEAL, I realized something: **we're always fighting threats after they've already gotten in**. Post-breach security is reactive. What if we could predict threats _before_ they execute?

That question led to Sentinel - a pre-breach prediction system that uses AI to reason about file behavior before anything runs.

### The Marathon Mode Evolution

For the Gemini 3 Hackathon's "Action Era" focus, I extended Sentinel into a **Marathon Agent** - transforming one-shot analysis into continuous autonomous monitoring that runs for hours, days, or weeks with self-learning capabilities.

### The Philosophy

- **SEAL**: Files that protect themselves after a breach (reactive)
- **Sentinel Single Mode**: AI that predicts threats before execution (proactive)
- **Sentinel Marathon Mode**: Autonomous agent that never stops learning and protecting (Action Era)

All share the same philosophy: **security should be intelligent and autonomous**, not just reactive rule-matching.

---

## 💡 What I Learned

### 1. **The False Positive Crisis**

Early versions of Sentinel had a major problem: **legitimate HEIC images from iPhones were flagged as CRITICAL threats**.

Why? Because:

- HEIC files have 7.2-7.99 entropy (very high, looks like encryption)
- The magic bytes are at offset 4, not offset 0 (my validator missed them)
- Unknown formats were automatically labeled "SUSPICIOUS"

This taught me that **context matters more than raw metrics**. A JPEG with 7.5 entropy is normal. A Word doc with 7.5 entropy is malware.

**Solution**: Built format-specific entropy baselines and offset-aware magic byte detection. Now Sentinel knows what's normal for each file type.

### 2. **AI Reasoning ≠ AI Summarization**

Initially, Sentinel was just using Gemini to summarize static analysis results. The hackathon feedback was harsh: _"Gemini is window dressing - it's just a fancy text summarizer. 5.6/10."_

They were right. I was feeding Gemini analysis results and asking it to make them sound smart. That's not AI innovation.

**The Fix**: Changed how I use Gemini entirely:

**Before:**

```
"Here's the analysis: entropy=7.8, unknown format, suspicious APIs.
Please summarize this as a threat report."
```

**After:**

```
"Given this file's behavior, what would happen if executed?
Predict: file operations, network activity, registry changes.
Reason through potential attack vectors."
```

Now Gemini **reasons** about threats instead of just summarizing data. That's the difference between a glorified template engine and actual AI security analysis.

### 3. **Multi-Stage Pipelines > Monolithic Analysis**

From my SEAL project, I learned that file security needs multiple specialized layers. You can't just run one "checkForMalware()" function.

Sentinel's **11-stage pipeline** breaks analysis into specialized modules:

1. Magic byte detection
2. Container parsing (ISOBMFF, RIFF)
3. Metadata extraction
4. Entropy baseline analysis
5. Threat scoring with weighted indicators
6. Steganography detection
7. Polyglot detection
8. Payload hunting
9. VirusTotal validation
10. AI threat reasoning
11. Sandbox behavior prediction

Each stage is independent and testable. If one breaks, the others still work.

### 4. **URL Analysis is Harder Than File Analysis**

Adding URL scanning seemed simple: "just fetch the HTML and analyze it." Wrong.

Real-world URLs are chaos:

- **Redirect chains**: Shortened links → CDN → final destination
- **Dynamic JavaScript**: Malicious code loads after page renders
- **Timeouts and failures**: Sites go down, firewalls block you
- **HTML parsing**: Extracting scripts/iframes/forms from malformed HTML

I spent hours debugging redirect loops, timeouts, and CORS issues. Files are deterministic. URLs are not.

### 5. **Speed vs Thoroughness Tradeoff**

I originally built a 3-agent debate system (Prosecutor → Defense → Judge) to show Gemini reasoning. It was cool, but **took 10-15 seconds per file**.

Users don't care about architectural cleverness if it's slow. I simplified to a single AI call with transparent reasoning: **3-5 seconds, same accuracy**.

Lesson: **Shipping beats sophistication.**

### 6. **Marathon Mode ≠ Serverless**

The biggest technical revelation came when designing Marathon Mode for the hackathon's "Action Era" track.

**The Problem**: I wanted continuous multi-day monitoring with learning capabilities. My first instinct was to deploy everything to Vercel (serverless) because it's free and easy.

**Reality Check**:

- Serverless functions have **time limits** (10-900 seconds max, depending on plan)
- Marathon Mode needs to run for **hours or days**
- Serverless filesystems are **ephemeral** - files disappear between invocations
- My learning baselines stored in `Map()` get wiped every request
- `chokidar` file watchers can't run persistent background processes

**The Solution**: Hybrid architecture

- **Web UI on Vercel** (serverless) - Perfect for one-shot file uploads
- **Marathon Mode on VPS** (traditional server) - Needed for continuous operation

This taught me that **not everything belongs in serverless**. Some problems require persistent state, long-running processes, and traditional server architectures. Choose the right tool for the job.

## 🔧 Technical Challenges I Faced

### Challenge 1: HEIC Detection at Offset 4

**Problem**: HEIC/HEIF/AVIF files have magic bytes at offset 4 (`ftyp`), not offset 0. My validator only checked offset 0, so all iPhone photos were "unknown format."

**Solution**: Built offset-aware signature matching:

```typescript
const SIGNATURES = [
  { ext: "heic", magic: [0x66, 0x74, 0x79, 0x70], offset: 4 },
  { ext: "jpeg", magic: [0xff, 0xd8, 0xff], offset: 0 },
  // ...
];
```

Then created an ISOBMFF parser to extract the `ftyp` brand (heic, heix, hevc, avif, etc.).

### Challenge 2: TypeScript Buffer Configuration

**Problem**: Node.js buffers don't work in TypeScript without proper config. Got constant errors:

```
Property 'from' does not exist on type 'Buffer'
```

**Solution**: Added to `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["node"],
    "lib": ["ES2022"]
  }
}
```

### Challenge 3: Context-Aware Pattern Matching

**Problem**: Searching for suspicious strings like "CreateProcess" flagged **every PDF** because PDF metadata contains those strings as text.

**Solution**: Built context-aware detection:

- Executables: Flag suspicious API calls in code sections
- PDFs: Ignore text content, only flag embedded executables
- Images: Flag appended executables or embedded scripts

The same string means different things depending on file type.

### Challenge 4: Balancing Speed and Thoroughness

**Problem**: Initial multi-agent AI debate system was thorough but slow (10-15 seconds).

**Solution**: Simplified to single AI call with structured reasoning. Still gets transparent explanations, 3x faster.

### Challenge 5: Marathon Mode Architecture for Serverless

**Problem**: Designed Marathon Mode with continuous file watching, learning baselines, and multi-day operation. Assumed I could deploy everything to Vercel for easy hosting.

**Reality**:

```typescript
// This doesn't work on Vercel
this.watcher = chokidar.watch(watchPath, { persistent: true });
this.threatBaselines = new Map(); // Wiped between requests
maxRuntime: 30 * 60 * 1000; // 30 minutes (Vercel max: 15 min)
```

Serverless platforms:

- Kill functions after 10-900 seconds
- Have ephemeral filesystems (no persistent storage)
- Don't support background processes
- Reset memory between invocations

**Solution**: Hybrid deployment strategy

- **Web UI + single-file API** → Vercel (perfect for one-shot analysis)
- **Marathon Mode** → VPS/traditional server (needed for persistent operation)
- Document both deployment paths clearly

This challenge taught me to **design with deployment constraints in mind from the start**, not as an afterthought.

## 🏗️ How It Works: Analysis Pipeline

### Core 6-Stage Pipeline (Current Implementation)

```
📁 File Upload (via multer)
    ↓
🔍 Stage 1: Magic Byte Detection
    • Offset-aware signature matching (PE, ELF, PDF, JPEG, PNG, HEIC, etc.)
    • Detects 30+ file formats
    • Extension mismatch detection (.jpg.exe spoofing)
    • Confidence scoring per match
    ↓
📊 Stage 2: Metadata Extraction
    • SHA-256 hash calculation
    • File size, mimetype, filename
    • Timestamps and attributes
    ↓
🎲 Stage 3: Entropy Analysis
    • Shannon entropy calculation (0-8 scale)
    • Measures randomness/encryption level
    • Context-aware: HEIC @ 7.8 = normal, EXE @ 7.8 = packed malware
    ↓
🔎 Stage 4: Pattern Detection
    • Shellcode patterns (NOP sleds)
    • Base64-encoded executables (PE/ZIP headers)
    • Suspicious API calls (CreateProcess, WriteFile, RegSetValue)
    • URLs and IP addresses embedded in files
    ↓
⚖️ Stage 5: Weighted Threat Scoring
    • Combines all evidence with weighted scoring:
      +30 pts: Very high entropy (>7.5)
      +40 pts: Extension mismatch
      +50 pts: Shellcode detected
      +45 pts: Base64 executable
      +35 pts: Suspicious APIs
    • Maps to threat levels:
      0-19 = SAFE | 20-39 = LOW | 40-59 = MEDIUM
      60-79 = HIGH | 80-100 = CRITICAL
    ↓
🤖 Stage 6: AI Threat Reasoning (Gemini 3 Flash Preview)
    • NOT just summarizing - actual behavioral prediction
    • Predicts what happens if file executes:
      - File operations it will perform
      - Network connections it will make
      - System changes it will attempt
    • Provides explainable threat assessment
    • Zero-day detection through reasoning
    ↓
⚖️ Stage 6.5: Multi-Agent Confidence Threshold (Intelligent)
    • Automatically triggers for borderline cases:
      - MEDIUM threat + confidence < 70%
      - Any threat with confidence < 60% (except SAFE)
    • Prosecutor → Defense → Judge debate system
    • Uses Gemini 3 Flash Preview (faster reasoning than previous models)
    • Improves accuracy on uncertain cases without slowing all analysis
    ↓
📊 Final Threat Report
    • Risk level + confidence score
    • Detailed indicators found
    • AI behavioral analysis
    • Actionable recommendations
```

### Advanced 11-Stage Pipeline (TypeScript Implementation)

The full implementation in `backend/src/` includes 6 additional stages:

- **Stage 7**: Steganography Detection (hidden data in images)
- **Stage 8**: Polyglot Detection (files valid as multiple formats)
- **Stage 9**: Payload Hunter (embedded executables in non-executable files)
- **Stage 10**: VirusTotal Integration (70+ AV engines)
- **Stage 11**: Sandbox Behavior Prediction (predicts file/network/registry operations)

#### NEW: Intelligent Multi-Agent System

- Multi-agent debate (Prosecutor/Defense/Judge) now uses **Gemini 3 Flash Preview** for advanced reasoning
- **Smart triggering**: Only activates for borderline cases (MEDIUM + low confidence)
- **Result**: Faster analysis (3-5s typical, 10-15s only when needed), better accuracy on edge cases

Run `npm run dev` from `backend/` to use the TypeScript version with all stages + intelligent multi-agent.
